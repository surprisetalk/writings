### [Academia is a Cult (HackerNews Comments)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18373737)

This comment-section had a lot of beautiful little remarks!

Somebody [compared academia to an MLM scheme](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18375276):
> MLM you say?
> Ok, let me see
> - peddling in private homes (friends and family)? check!
> - using social connections as marketing channel (classmates, friends and family)? check!
> - promising benefits, while customers have to pay upfront and wait years for see their investment (never) pay off? check!
> - turning customers to promoters (work environments turn away applicants without XYZ degree)? check!
> - kick-back/ROI is distributed in ways that are "opaque" at best for customers? check! 

Somebody else [recommended teaching pop and hip-hop in high-schools rather than classical](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18374624). Somebody made an interesting comparison to teaching JS vs. C++.

Lastly, I found [this little gem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18375146):
> The difference between a cult and a religion: a cult wants it all, a religion just wants its cut.

Drum Corps seems a bit silly from the outside. I mean, it's impressive in its scope, but it's definitely not my cup-of-tea.

Anyway, I just wanted to make a mental note of the music composition in these pieces -- SO HYPE. I'm totally going to steal some of the melody and rhythms for my own music!

The part from [2:45](https://youtu.be/X4GMf43z_vc?t=165) to [3:27](https://youtu.be/X4GMf43z_vc?t=210) is incredible! That glide effect mixes so beautifully with those giant jazz chords!

### [Petri Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net)

Petri Nets are really neat! They're a nice graphical notation for distributed systems. It seems much nicer than using the [π-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus) (which is also super cool).
Apparently it was invented by Carl Petri at age 13 for desrcibing chemical interactions!

I'd like to see more notations like this and Feynman diagrams.

Check out my new page on [Experimental Notations](/essays/Experimental Notations)!

### [Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/demo/)

It's a floating-point equation optimizer!

### [Homestuck](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=homestuck)

I love niche communities!

This is definitely rabbit-hole I want to investigate.

### [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io)

What a nifty concurrent languge!

### [Cyberise.Me](https://cyberise.me/)

I'm a sucker for _literal_ bleeding-edge technology.

### Art with Haskell

#### [Generating artwork with Haskell](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html)

I had the pleasure of meeting Benjamin at Strange Loop this year.

His work is so inspiring!

#### [Euterpea](http://www.euterpea.com/)

I really want to start doing more music/programming stuff! Haskell seems like a great language for that.

Apparently [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Haskell-School-Music-Signals-Symphonies/dp/1108416756/) has high accolades.

I __love__ ContraPoints! Her [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1afqR5QkDM) is incredible!

## 2018/09/19 1909h 

I'm almost finished watching [Planet With](http://www.crunchyroll.com/planet-with).

I can say, with confidence, that this series is largest difference in quality I've ever seen between a story and its cinematography. This show has a unique and thought-provoking premise with animation that is _utter garbage_. The CGI is horrendous and most of the robots are super lame.

But once again, its story is actually quite interesting if you can stomach the animation.

Maybe I'll do a more in-depth review later!

I found some lectures I wanted to download and used the following script to download them all:
```bash
youtube-dl -i $(lynx -listonly -nonumbers -dump http://cufp.org/videos/)
```

Computers are amazing, aren't they?

I'm almost finished listening to _The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs_.

I want to do a recap/review when I'm finished, but for now, all I can say is "whoa".

## 2018/09/17 1853h

I spend a lot of time watching "interesting" things and listening to other people's opinons.

How do I escape the endless trap of browsing the internet to say, "oh, that's pretty cool"? 

And like, why do I care so much about others' opinions? You wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent watching anime analyses. Why does it matter? Why do I care?

I'd like to rid myself of these desires, but I don't know how.

## 2018/09/15 1406h

I'll be posting stuff about my media consumption here.

I plan to do reviews of things, along with my general thoughts about media consumption.
