    <p>I think we lost something when we moved from analog to digital clocks.</p>
    <p>
        Our lives used to be cyclical.
        Every moment had its point on the perimiter of a circle.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Clocks used to ask us, "Who will you be in 10 years, if you continue to repeat today again and again?"<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Time's hands waved like semaphore operators, reminding us that no ship stays afloat forever.
        But I guess that time has passed.
        <!-- No more holding hands. -->
        <!-- bells -->
    </p>

        <!-- bells -->

    <h3 id="clock"></h3>

    <p>
        Now time is linear.
        Men and machines obey a single number: the milliseconds since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Everything seems to be ahead of us and behind us, with no time for "now".
    </p>

    <p>
        But we're blessed to live in an age of progress.<br/>
        Every minute something new is happening (I guess that's why we have so much <em>news</em>). We have access to high-quality goods and services, often instantly-accessible.<br/>
        I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to binge-watch anime - it means that I'm not farming, or mining, or warding off invaders.
    </p>

    <!-- I always feel like I'm wasting time, but that just means that I have time to waste! -->

    <p>
        Sometimes I just wish that our clocks would start holding hands again.
        And that linear time would slow down enough to remind me that I've already been alive for <span id="age">way too many</span> days.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have more time than ever before. Let's make it count.
    </p>

    <!-- time changing her pace when observed -->

    <!-- Time hasn't increased her pace, we've just been watching her more granuarly -- cutting her up into smaller and smaller pieces.-->

    <blockquote>
        On one hand, we've got hours.<br/>
        On the other hand, we've got minutes.
